		<description>
			<p>Legends speak of gnolls spread across the all planes of existence: demonic, snarling, bloodthirsty creatures under the command of a terrifying demon lord. The first gnolls to fall through the Shimmering Veil into Avestros might have been of such savage and mindless character, but after millenia apart from the rest of the multiverse, and the oversight and influence of their vicious creator, Avestrosian gnolls have grown to overcome their feral instinct and craft their own destiny.</p>
			<p>Similar in appearance and power to the gnolls feared on other planes, the life of an Avestrosian gnoll is one of restless temperance—an eternal balancing act between an ancient, clawing instinct for destruction and a blossoming desire for freedom, kinship, and peace. A great deal of gnoll art and contemporary philosophy explores this discordance at the heart of each individual’s soul, and the journey of each gnoll is one of self-discovery and exploration a quest to turn a killer instinct to the pursuit of a life beyond mayhem and revelry. Those who succeed rise to greatness as true masters of themselves and their own destiny. The few gnoll who fail are as deadly as they are tragic—fallen monstrosities who roam the lands as slaves to their own monstrous instinct.</p>
