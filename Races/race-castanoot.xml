		<description>
			<p>Castanoot are a race of small, fey creatures native to the feywild who are notable for their thick, spined shells. An ancient and deeply solitary peoples, Castanoot are famously distrustful of outsiders and seek to avoid interaction with others if they can. However, they have been known to trade and associate with other races on occasion. Trust is hard earned however, and easily lost. Castanoot have a strong distrust of Fairies for an insult dealt unto them long ago that none remember, aside from the fact it came from the tongue of a Fairy. Although Castanoot can burrow, they typically live in woodland areas, building homes inside trees. They age rapidly from birth, reaching adulthood in just 5 years, and then go on to live for around a century. There are three main variants: The Caescean, Dentata, and Sativan.</p>
