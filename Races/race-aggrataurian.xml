		<description>
			<p>“Flightless and frightful” was the description given by famed gnoll explorer Ignobious Riot upon discovering a roaming band of aggrataurian in the Craggy Mountains of western Avestros. Aggrataurian are towering, highly aggressive, flightless bird-folk, widely known as “jerks” by most outsiders. At first, it was believed that aggrataurian were isolationists, viewing any non-aggrataurian as a threat worthy of fierce assault. However, as time passed and outsiders saw aggrataurian they treated one another with the same ferocity as any other species, it came to be understood that these people were just “kind of like that”.</p>
			<p>Aggrataurian are highly aggressive. They live to brawl, and solve problems with direct physical confrontation where possible. They are not actively murderous, however, merely viewing hand-to-beak combat as the most efficient way to solve problems. Aggrataurians believe that all hierarchy is ultimately dictated by force, so why not cut the nonsense and work out who’s top of the pecking order right here and now?</p>
			<p>In recent years, through repeated efforts from various species to develop trade and bonds with the aggrataurian, some individuals have learned to quell their fighting tendencies long enough to hold a conversation with others. However, even the most habituated aggratuarian is always down for a scrap, and are known to be swift in misreading anything from a friendly wave to a passing compliment as an invitation to fight.</p>
