		<description>
			<p>Ancient legends tell that the first Aemyr were created by a powerful, empathetic archfey who sought to create guardians for the natural world across all planes of existence. Aemyr have been found on many planes, uniquely adapted to suit their environment. There are two primary subraces that exist on the Material Plane: The Flaxfoot and The Lowstone.</p>
			<p>Flaxfoot Aemyr usually dwell in forests, and by natural disposition are playful and merry. They have an unfortunate reputation for gluttony, and overindulgence in fine food and drink, however this is largely unfounded. Flaxfoot enjoy the bounties of their forest home to the fullest, but they are no more greedy or gluttonous than any other race. Still, rarely do travellers who come upon a Flaxfoot town leave the next morning without a full belly and ringing hangover.</p>
			<p>Lowstone Aemyr are mountain dwellers. Acclimated to life at the very peak of the tallest mountains, they are a rare sight on the lands below. Many Mountain Dwarf legends feature Lowstone as invisible protectors or guardians to those who fall foul of the mountain. They are rumoured to have the power to sense volcanic eruptions and earthquakes before they happen, and have long aided Dwarves building mighty mountain fortresses in ways that will not provoke the mountain’s wrath.</p>
