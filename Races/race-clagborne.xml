		<description>
			<p>A peculiar species of subterranean magical ooze, Clagborne are a deeply mysterious race. Unique in that they are fully amorphous and brainless until they find a host, almost nothing is known of a Clagborne’s early life or origin, as even they remember nothing of it.</p>
			<p>What is known is that these brainless oozes slime their way through caverns and dungeons on instinct, until they come upon a humanoid corpse. At this point, the Clagborne strips the body of its flesh and tissue, magically absorbing all chemical and electrical information, and is “born” as a new entity, complete with all the memories of its fallen host.</p>
			<p>The ooze wraps around the skeleton, forming a new body in the model of the old. A Clagborne can alter the transparency and colour of its slime flesh to suit its wishes.</p>
			<p>Although a Clagborne retains the memories their original form had in life and are functionally identical in personality, desires and ability, they are a distinct creature. The soul of the departed does not return to the Clagborne, and many struggle coming to terms with their identity. Are they the same person as they were in life? Or an abominable walking undead, host to a parasitic, brainless monster?</p>
			<h4>CLAGBORNE TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Clagborne are formed by a brainless ooze melding with a humanoid corpse. You may choose the humanoid race your Clagborne melded with, and use some of its statistics in your stat block. At your DMs discretion, you may become a Clagborne after your player character dies and melds with the ooze.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2 and another ability score of your choice increases by 1. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, replace any Ability Score Increases you previously had with this.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write any languages your original race knew in life, or you can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are an Ooze.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are the same size as your original race, or your size can be medium or small.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Even if your base race had a natural flying or swimming speed, you do not.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unusual Nature.</em></strong> You don’t need to breathe and you do not age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Clagborne Legacy.</em></strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can retain any skill proficiencies you gained from it. If not, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. In addition, if your original race could take a feat with a racial prerequisite, you can still take it as a Clagborne.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ooze.</em></strong> You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed, and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> While you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your constitution modifier. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Malleable Form.</em></strong> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size equal to or larger than yours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Translucency.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can alter the translucency of your ooze body, potentially frightening an enemy by revealing the skeleton within. When you do so, one creature of your choice with 15ft who can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Whenever you roll a hit dice to recover hit points, treat any number rolled on that dice as the maximum. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>
