		<description>
			<p>From tempestuous ocean, to trembling forest, to stark, belligerent mountainside, anywhere the natural world breathes freely, dryads call home. Typically solitary folk, dryads are most content among the company of one another and the solace of nature.</p>
			<p>Throughout history, most clashes between dryads and other species have been in response to the other’s aspirations of conquest and domination negatively impacting the natural world. Dryads have a reputation for civility and patience, but it swiftly veers into ruinous fury and retribution when harm is done to nature. Many dryads proudly declare themselves as protectors of The World, and value the lives of simple beasts, plants, and even mountains as equal to those of “intelligent” beings.</p>
			<h4>DRYAD TRAITS</h4>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dryads mature slower than humans, reaching adulthood at around 30 years of age. They can live for up to 300 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dryads vary greatly in size. Your size is Small or Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

While possessed, the plant gains the awakened shrub stat block, except its size changes to match the size of the plant you possessed, and it shares your place in initiative and obeys your mental commands (no action required). If the plant is reduced to 0 hit points, you are ejected from it, landing prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.</p>
