		<description>
			<p>Beneath eternal, inky skies and over bitter, icy wastes, a race of nomads beat a weary trail. These people are the lamnites, perhaps the most mysterious beings native to Avestros. In a magical continent of microclimates, where blistering desert borders verdant forest, the lamnite call the endless tundra that devours the south of Avestors their home. Trembling rays of sunlight reach their territory for only minutes each day, with the rest of a native lamnite’s existence spent in aching dark and cold. It is a hard life, but one for which lamnites are well adapted. They are weavers of darkness—able to command, conjure, and dispel it. Some folk view lamnites with suspicion, as few of them venture north of their icy territory and still fewer care to dispel fearful notions of their shadowy magic. Lamnite, however, view their shadow magic and cruel home quite differently. Rather than a people that celebrate darkness and isolation, they view their very existence as the ultimate rebellion against it. For if they can stride through darkness and call its power for their own, then they are living proof that no creeping shadow or biting tundra can quench the breath and light of life.</p>
