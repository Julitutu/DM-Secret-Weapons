	<!-- PELAGGION RACE -->

		<description>
			<p>Pelaggion are an amphibious, mammalian race of humanoids native to the shores and islands of Avestros. A common sight on the continent, Pelaggion are rarely found outside its borders. With powerful bodies well adapted for swift motion across both land and ocean, Pelaggion society is wholly structured around the sanctity of The Hunt and an individual’s personal value to the tribe.</p>
			<p>Each Pelaggion has a niche, and they take great pride in their area of expertise. To be rendered “useless” through injury or superior competition is a terrible fate to a Pelaggion. Many leave the tribe and oceans to seek fortune or die alone if they feel they can no longer provide a tangible contribution to their community. They are often sought out as fortune-tellers or advisors, due to their ability to see glimpses of the near future.</p>
