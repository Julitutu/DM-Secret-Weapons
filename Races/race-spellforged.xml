		<description>
			<p>Either through chaotic, explosive interactions of latent magic, or through the meticulous design of a powerful spellcaster, Spellforged are the very essence of the weave forged into consciousness. Spellforged created by spellcasters like liches and dracomages are often mindless servants who only gain control of their mind and destiny upon their master’s destruction. Even while thralls to a greater being, however, these beings of pure magical energy feel emotion, pain and pleasure the same as any other creature.</p>
			<p>The life of a free spellforged is often as chaotic as the explosive interactions that brought about their birth. Lacking any parents, culture, heritage, or purpose, they often wander the world, seeking fulfillment in any way they can find it. This may mean helping the vulnerable, forming communities with other spellforged, or gathering personal power. Their unstable ties to the weave tend spellforged toward Chaotic alignments.</p>
			<h4>SPELLFORGED TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma or Wisdom score increases by 2, and Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Spellforged vary in size, but typically take a humanoid appearance, with two legs, two arms, and a head. Your size is Medium or Small.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Into the Weave.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can magically teleport yourself or one willing creature within 5ft of you up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magical Form.</em></strong> As a being of energy, you have limited control over your form. You know the spell alter self and can cast it without a spell slot. Once you cast it in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magical Resilience.</em></strong> You are a being born from magic, which confers the following benefits: You have proficiency in the Arcana skill. You are immune to disease and the poisoned condition. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. You are immune to spells and effects that would dispel the magic that binds you together.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellborne.</em></strong> The magic that bound you together grants you access to elemental power. Choose one damage type from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. You gain a resistance to the chosen damage type, and your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier of the chosen damage type. You glow and pulse with magical energy that reflects your chosen elemental power. You might radiate heat as a fire spellforged, or crackle with a static energy as a lightning one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read and write Common and Primordial.</p>
