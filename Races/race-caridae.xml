		<description>
			<p>Caridae are an amphibious, jungle dwelling race. They come in four main types: Fire-Belly, Galvanic, Poison Dart and Kinetic. Caridae grow into their type upon reaching adulthood. These types seem to have no genetic bearing. For example, two parent Fire-Belly Caridae might produce an offspring that grows into a Galvanic. As such, many myths and legends exist in Caridae folklore attempting to explain where Caridae powers come from, and what they mean.</p>
			<p>Caridae live relatively short lives and are innately curious and trusting. This naivety is sometimes attributed as stupidity to cynical outsiders, but Caridae are as intelligent as any other sentient race. They simply have a natural inclination to take words and people at face value.</p>
			<h4>CARIDAE TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution, Dexterity and Strength scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Caridae are famously variable in size, even within the same family. Grown Caridae range from 3 feet to 7 feet tall. Your size is small or medium (your choice).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Caridae reach adulthood in their early teens, and go on to live for around half a century.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30ft.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> You have a swim speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hold your breath for up to four hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Adhesive.</em></strong> You are naturally sticky. You have advantage on any skill checks you make to climb or hold onto something, and other creatures have disadvantage on any skill check they make to escape being grappled by you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> Your claws are natural weapons. When you make an unarmed strike using them, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cacophonous Croak.</em></strong> Caridae can speak at an incredible volume. At full intensity, your words can be heard and understood clearly from up to 1,000 feet away.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Jungle Born.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Nature skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> All Caridae develop a unique biological trait in adulthood. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
