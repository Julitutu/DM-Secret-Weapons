		<description>
			<p>Created by Celestial Gods to articulate their designs on the material plane, Westurai are a mysterious, enigmatic race devoted entirely to their divine purpose.</p>
			<p>Each is magically hewn from stone with a fully formed mind and impetus. Be it to guard a temple, gather information, destroy evil, or explore the world, most Westurai have their actions dictated to the letter by the god who created them. They obey these orders unthinkingly and without passion.</p>
			<p>However, should their orders cease to arrive, perhaps through the death of a god or a severing of the divine connection, a Westurai becomes free to act independently, forging their own destiny as a living being.</p>
			<h4>WESTURAI TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> You do not age. Westurai are created fully formed, and have no concept of childhood, youth, or old age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Westurai tend towards lawful good alignments, but those free of their creator’s influence may drift towards more neutral and chaotic outlooks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> You have a base walking speed of 30ft, and a flying speed equal to your walking speed. In order to sustain your heavy body in flight, you require maximum maneuverability. You can’t fly while wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>From Stone.</em></strong> Your body was hewn from stone before being imbued with magic. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Stone Form.</em></strong> As an action, you can shift into a being of pure stone. You and all objects you are holding turn to stone. Your movement speed becomes 0, attack rolls against you are made at advantage, and you auto fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws. In addition, you resist all damage, you have advantage on constitution and wisdom saving throws, and you can’t take any actions, except to use an action to return to normal. You are indistinguishable from a true statue. Only a creature who succeeds on an investigation check (DC 13) can identify you as a Westurai.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Impetus.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws to resist the charmed condition, and you gain proficiency in the Religion skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Magic.</em></strong> You know the Mending cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Sanctuary spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Calm Emotions spell with this trait. Once you cast Sanctuary or Calm Emotions with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).</p>
