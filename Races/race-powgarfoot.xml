    <!-- POWGARFOOT RACE -->

	<element name="Powgarfoot" type="Race" source="DM Secret Weapons" id="ID_DMSW_RACE_POWGARFOOT">
		<description>
			<p>Making their home in the temperate, mountainous forests of Avestros, Powgarfoot are an ursine race of humanoids. Hulking, sociable, and independant, they typically prefer to keep out of conflict, unfettered by the politics and warfare of other races. All are welcome in a Powgarfoot village, free to stay as long as they wish, and to take as much food as they desire.</p>
			<p>Powgarfoot take enormous pleasure in food. Eating, cooking, sharing, and storing it are acts of delight and great cultural significance. All events, be they funerals, weddings, birthdays, weekends, or weekdays, are marked with a great feast. Their cuisine is famous across the land as delicious and eclectic. There is no dish a Powgarfoot will not sample, and very few meals they will not enjoy.</p>
