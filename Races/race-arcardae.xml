		<description>
			<p>Across the infinite multiverse, life blooms in every imaginable biome, and in every imaginable shape. Of all the sentient forms life takes, there is perhaps no greater mismatch in disposition and physiology than the terrifying arcardae. Gruesomely ugly spider-folk, arcardae have the upper torso of a humanoid sat atop the bulbous, bloated abdomen of a colossal spider. Similar in appearance to the demonic driders of the underworld, arcardae inspire understandable revulsion and terror in the eyes of most they meet.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, however, arcardae prove the old adage correct: one cannot judge a book by its cover. A gentle, herbivorous species, these spider-folk are well regarded by those who know them as naturally thoughtful, tolerant, and open-minded people. Though their monstrous form provides them ample power to defend themselves if attacked, arcardae philosophy touts the virtues of nonviolence. Their society boasts very few soldiers and no war industry, and yet history carries few accounts of aggression from other species aiming to exploit their pacifistic ways. Many scholars posit that the arcardae’s hideous appearance acts as a natural deterrent to potential invaders, who assume the spider-folk to be mighty, flesh-eating monsters not worth tangling with.</p>
