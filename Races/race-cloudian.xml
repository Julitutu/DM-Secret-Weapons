		<description>
			<p>The breath of creation reverberates through all things, even natural phenomena. In rare instances, where the breath of life sings deep and loud, conscious thought is born, forming a body from the fundamental force it once was. Cloudians are one such race of people, born eons ago from clouds who sought to live among the creatures they gazed down upon.</p>
			<p>A typically affable and peaceful folk, cloudians claim no region or country as their own, effortlessly integrating among other peoples all across the globe as they see fit. This “open borders’’ approach to territory has been known to vex more isolationist countries where cloudians settle, but the soporific speech and affable character of cloudians is so disarming that even the most hardline separatist societies have come to accept their presence without protest. As such, with only a gentle smile and spectacular inability to comprehend they might not be welcome, many cloudians have peacefully settled in lands that armies have failed to conquer for millenia.</p>
