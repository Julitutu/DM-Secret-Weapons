		<description>
			<p>A compound race, Pooka are unlike any other humanoid in that their brain (known as The Gnute) exists separately from their body. The Gnute is housed in the centre of a living, symbiotic “shell” organism (known as The Ultat). The two creatures are born together, sharing the same thoughts, desires and sensory information. Together, they form a Pooka.</p>
			<p>In very rare, tragic cases, the connection between the Gnute and the Ultat can be severed. At this time, the Ultat ceases to hear the commands of the Gnute, and is driven by instinct. This leaves the Gnute to wither, existing as a prisoner inside a body they cannot command, impotently observing its actions. In this form, the Pooka is dangerously aggressive and primal. Pooka who’s Gnute and Ultat are not working in unison are referred to as being “desynchronised” by others of their kind. Although the condition is treatable, once the Gnute and Ultat have been disconnected, the Pooka is forever changed. Pooka who are saved and reunited return altered by the magical trauma of the experience.</p>
