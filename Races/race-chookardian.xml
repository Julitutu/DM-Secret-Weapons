		<description>
			<p>In a bustling, ancient, criss-cross network of caverns and tunnels, the Chookardian build homes, raise livestock, and thrive beneath the notice of most surface dwellers.</p>
			<p>Happily beating a peaceful existence largely removed from the rest of the world, only rarely do Chookardian meet with surface dwellers to trade materials, knowledge, and stories. These cultural exchanges are deeply significant, with the Chookardian sending an honoured expedition party to the surface world, resplendent with the finest works of Chookardian craft to barter for supplies for the tribe.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, a Chookardian may choose to stay above ground, either to fulfil a personal goal or to embark a self-imposed mission to obtain wondrous resources to improve the life of their kin.</p>
