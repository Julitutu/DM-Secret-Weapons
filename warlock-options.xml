			<p>You gain proficiency with shields and medium armour, and wearing medium armour doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Over the course of a long rest, you can attune to a shield, bonding to it as you imbue it with eldritch magic. While holding that shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free. You can still only benefit from one shield at a time. Once you you command your shield to animate in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your bonded shield is destroyed or is more than 5-feet away from you, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to conjure it in your hands, unharmed.</p>
