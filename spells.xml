For as long as a creature is in the wall, it is blinded and deafened, and cannot breathe, speak, or perform the verbal components of spells. It also cannot stand up from being prone, take the dodge or dash action, and has disadvantage on dexterity saving throws. A creature has resistance to all damage types except psychic while it is in the wall of slime.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spell transforms a creature with at least 1 hit point that you can see within range into a frog or toad. An unwilling creature must make a Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect. A Shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The target assumes the form of either a Frog or a Giant Toad (your choice).</p>
			<p class="indent">Their game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target assumes the Hit Points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of Hit Points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 Hit Points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature cannot cast spells, speak, or take any action that would be limited by the capabilities of their frog or toad form. Transforming does not break concentration on a spell they have already cast, however, or prevent them from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that they have already cast.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its Equipment.</p>

			<p>You attempt to manipulate the life flow of energy within one huge or smaller creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, you take control of its body until the end of the turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you control a creature in this way, it cannot move in any way that you do not allow. You can use your bonus action to take total and precise control of the target, during which time you can force the creature to move up to its movement speed and take an action, but you cannot force the creature to cast a spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, you might force an Adult Red Dragon to fly 40 feet, use its breath weapon attack, and then fall prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">And any damage the creature takes while under your control is also dealt to you, as your life force intertwines with its own. At the end of the turn, the creature is freed of your influence.</p>

			<p>Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 minute. Once created, you can use your action to influence the sensory effect, turning a golden orb into falling snow, etc. If you do, make a Nature skill check (DC20). On a success, the weather at your location shifts over the course of the next 24 hours to reflect the effect you created. You cannot create weather of an intensity that would threaten life in the area. Once you use this feature to attempt to change the weather in your location, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>
				<li>You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.</li>
				<li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.</li>
				<li>You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
				<li>You instantly know the location of all edible, poisonous, or sentient plants in a 300-foot radius.</li>
			</ul>

They are to accompany a member of the Royal Guard to the Royal Court for urgent business”. The illusion is incapable of replicating or forging sigils and other official means of authentication.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature chooses to do so, they can attempt an Arcana check (DC20) to identify if the parchment carries an illusion. On a success, they become aware that the parchment bears magic, but still cannot read the original message.</p>

			<p>You invoke the abyssal fury of a dominating, demonic entity. When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can focus your gaze on one creature you can see within 120 feet. That creature must make a Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, it suffers one of the following effects, based on the saving throw you chose.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Constitution.</strong> The target is stunned until the start of your next turn or until they are no longer within your line of sight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Wisdom.</strong> The target suffers the effects of the Confusion spell until the end of their next turn or until they are no longer within your line of sight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Charisma.</strong> The target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until they are no longer within your line of sight. This effect ends early if you deal damage to that creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you drop concentration on this spell as a result of taking damage, roll a d20. On a 13 or lower, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are corrupted by darkness for the next minute. While corrupted, you can’t differentiate friend from foe, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, can’t cast spells, and speak only gibberish.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can use its action to attempt to help you regain yourself. If they do, roll a d20. On a 13 or higher, you return to your senses. A Greater Restoration spell cast on you also ends the corruption effect.</p>

			<p>Your body ignites with frenetic energy, which you channel into a magically charged, shattering strike. Make an unarmed strike or melee weapon attack against one creature or object within your reach. If the target is an object or a Construct, you have advantage on the attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers the strike’s normal effects, and its AC is reduced by 1 until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s AC reduction increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the strike imposes an additional penalty of -1 to the target’s AC (-2 AC). The same applies at 11th level (-3 AC) and 17th level (-4 AC).</p>

			<p>With a burst of silver and crimson sparks, you throw a melee weapon you are holding into the air, where it hovers beside you for the duration. While the weapon hovers, you can use a bonus action to telepathically command it to fly up to 30 feet and attack one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The weapon uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and deals magical damage. If the weapon is within 30 feet of you, you can recall it to your open hand and make a single attack with it as a bonus action, after which the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also cast this spell targeting a shield. If you do, the shield hovers in place by your side for the duration, conferring its benefit while leaving your hands free.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the weapon you animate can make two attacks as a bonus action, rather than just one, and the shield confers an additional +1 bonus to your AC.</p>

		<supports>Druid, Ranger, Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer</supports>
		<description>
			<p>One berry appears in your hand, infused with deadly magic. It appears identical to an ordinary goodberry. A creature can use its action to eat the berry. Alternatively, you can attempt a melee attack roll using the berry (with which you are proficient) against an unwilling creature no more than one size larger than you to force the berry into its mouth, causing it to swallow it (this attack deals no damage). A creature that swallows the berry takes 10d6+40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.</p>
