		<description>
			<p>Across all times and cultures, warriors have fought and died in the name of the gods. There are few, however, who can truly claim to be chosen by them. Monks of the Radiant Soul infuse their blistering agility and technique with the divine power of the Higher Planes. Some such warriors are chosen from birth, while others find relationships with Higher Beings through deep, transcendent meditation. In all cases, they are fearsome in battle, fortified and bolstered by the holy power of the gods.</p>
