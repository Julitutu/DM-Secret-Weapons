			<p>The innate magic that flows through your veins is Demonic in origin, a dark power that burns with a desire to be wielded in battle. Often, Sorcerers with this origin can trace their powers back to a dark bargain or blood pact made by an ancestor with a powerful Demon, or even claim a parent as one possessed by a Demon. Sometimes, these powers manifest in individuals seemingly at random, perhaps as a result of the unknowable machinations of a powerful Demon Lord in another realm of existence, or as an unpredictable, chaotic burst of Demonic energy latching onto a host.</p>
