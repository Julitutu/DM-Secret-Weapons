		<description>
			<p>Druids of the Circle of Barkarmour fortify themselves with the immutable power of the Ironthorn Forest. Barkarmour druids are legendary carpenters and fierce warriors, harnessing the abjuration-infused plants native to Ironthorn to fortify their clothing with incredible magic; the result is the legendarily tough and flexible garb known as Barkarmour.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many druids of this circle tend to forests as guardians, ferociously defending the woodland’s borders from poachers, monsters, and any who would trample the natural world for their own gain. Others of this circle travel the world, sowing the seeds of Ironthron far and wide and cultivating its plants and magic wherever they tread. To all barkarmour druids, the relationship with nature is one of symbiotic protection; the magic of Ironthorn guards and invigorates all who bond with it, and in turn, members of this circle wield its power in staunch defense of the wilds.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are using the 2024 rules for character creation, you gain the 2nd level barkarmour druid subclass features at 3rd level instead.</p>

			<p>The magic of the Ironthorn forest confers unto you the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

You gain proficiency with Carpenter’s Tools, and you can craft a set of magical Light Armour, known as barkarmour, over the course of a Long Rest. The barkarmour you create is tailored specifically to connect with your druidic power; only you can wield it. As you advance in levels, the potency of your barkarmour increases, as shown in the Druidic Armourcraft table below.</p>
