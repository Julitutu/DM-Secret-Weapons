			<p>Deep beneath the crust of the material plane, the end of the world slumbers. In dreamless sleep waits a monstrosity with power not to rival Gods, but devour them. The true name of the creature is lost to time, but its strength persists. Those who syphon this strength refer to the creature as the Unspeakable.</p>
			<p class="indent">Warlocks of the Unspeakable are beings infused with primal fury and might, who draw magical power from a sleeping monstrosity. Such power is not meant for mortal beings, and those who channel it heedlessly undergo painful transformations; the bones thicken like aged oak trunks, the skin hardens and cracks like volcanic rock, and the voice drops and rasps like grinding stone. The reward is primal magic pulled from an infinite well of power.</p>
