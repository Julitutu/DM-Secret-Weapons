			<p>Many Paladins seek to protect the innocent, but those who take the Oath of Merriment seek more. They aim not to only save lives, but give them purpose and meaning; to spread merriment and joy.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Oath of Merriment pledges equal worth to physical and emotional freedom. Paladins of this order spread goodwill and companionship to all those they meet. After all, what is the gift of life for but to be enjoyed?</p>
			<p class="indent">Spreading this message, Merriment Paladins oppose agents of misery, cruelty and suffering wherever they find them, and take pride in finding reasons to live well, even in the darkest of times.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tenets of Merriment</b></p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Joy.</b> To live well means to live with joy. All sentient life has a right to happiness, and you strive to build a world where none are condemned to misery and hopelessness.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Safety.</b> To live well means to feel secure. Protecting the innocent is paramount, and you protect others by being powerful yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Companionship.</b> To live well means to share life with others. You are a uniter of all peoples, and place great importance on bonds of friendship and family.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Acceptance.</b> To live well means allowing all to live well. You need not understand the ways of people to respect them. As long as they don’t spread misery or pain, you seek to defend the cultures and beliefs of all people.</p>

			<p>When you take this Oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>The Right Path.</b> As an action, you place your hand on a non-hostile creature and bless them with divine energy. You have advantage on all Charisma (persuasion) checks against that creature for the next minute. In addition, if that creature was originally good-aligned and its alignment has changed, it is restored to its original alignment.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Divine Gift.</b> As a bonus action, you conjure a number of tiny magic boxes equal to your charisma modifier, which appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 ft of you. Choose a creature within range when you conjure each box. That box can only be opened by the chosen creature. As an action, the chosen creature can open a box to receive a benefit, and the box then vanishes. If unopened, the boxes disappear after 24 hours, or when you use this feature again. When you create each box, choose one of the following benefits to store within:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Soul. The creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your paladin level (rounded up) + charisma modifier.</li>
				<li>Spirit. The creature gains a point of inspiration.</li>
				<li>Heart. Opening the gift cures one of the following conditions affecting a creature (their choice when they open it): Charmed, Frightened, Poisoned, Blinded, or Deafened.</li>
