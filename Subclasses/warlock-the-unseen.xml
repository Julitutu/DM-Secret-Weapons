			<p>Unburdened by mortality, morality, and fear, ever rising and falling in the dark and hopeless places of the world, exists an idea. It is a gnawing concept; a thought as invisible and infectious as a virus. It is called The Unseen.</p>
			<p class="indent">Followers of The Unseen answer not to a dark god or monstrosity. Instead, they draw power from an ideology, and a community of fellow believers. The Unseen is a philosophy of unity and destruction; a call to the downtrodden and unwanted to band together and set the world alight. Members of The Unseen operate in the shadows, an ever growing collective seeking the ruination of modern society. Under the cover of nightfall, ordinary men and womenâ€“teachers, doctors, beggars, and merchants, don masks and perform rituals to beckon in the coming chaos.</p>
			<p class="indent">The motivations of individuals may vary wildly. Some believe the current rule of the world is corrupt and wicked, and seek to reverse the fortunes of the tyrannised and build a new order for the benefit of the people. Others seek personal power, eager to spread carnage and rise like smoke through its chaos. In all cases, The Unseen draw strength from one another, empowered by a vision of a new world. To the mighty and powerful, there is no threat more terrifying.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Unseen is labelled as an anarchistic cult and outlawed in most empires, and membership is punishable by death. However, no matter the brutal retribution of the state, The Unseen seem to grow ever more numerous, harbingers of a new order that will rise from the ashes of the world they burn. If you dare dream of a better world, and are willing to do whatever it takes to bring it to bear, seek out The Unseen.</p>
