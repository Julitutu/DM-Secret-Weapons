			<p>Calamity Barbarians draw upon the raw, primal energies of the material plane. They embrace the reality that the forces of nature rule above all. Earthquakes topple the mightiest of kingdoms; tidal waves decimate the greatest fleets.</p>
			<p class="indent">Contrary to what the cruellest tyrants and noblest kings may wish to believe, there are no heights mortals can reach that cannot be torn asunder by natural disaster.</p>
			<p class="indent">Embracing this chaotic power, a Calamity Barbarian’s greataxe may be struck by lightning as it falls in a blast of power, or a javelin may ignite in flame as it soars through the air. When angered, they are a walking natural disaster, channelling the immeasurable wrath of a calamity.</p>
