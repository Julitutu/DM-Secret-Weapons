			<p>Your primordial lineage grants you power. You gain one of the following elemental boons of your choice. When you finish a long rest, you can change your choice. Your current elemental boon also impacts the abilities you receive at later levels.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Earth.</b> Your skin is as hardy and durable as stone. Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your Sorcerer level. In addition, while you aren’t wearing armour, you can calculate your AC as 12+ your Constitution modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Water.</b> You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. In addition, the first time you hit a creature with a spell attack roll each turn, you can push that creature up to 15 feet away from you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Fire.</b> You resist cold damage. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can change the damage type of that spell to fire damage. Finally, spells you cast that deal fire damage ignore damage resistance.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Air.</b> Your walking speed increases by 10 feet and your AC increases by 1 while you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armour. In addition, whenever you cast a spell that targets only yourself, or you take the Dash or Disengage action, you gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed until the end of the turn. If you end that turn in the air, you fall.</p>
