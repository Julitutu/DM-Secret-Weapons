			<p>The pulse of life beats fast in dark, winding city streets all across Avestros. Millions of lives crammed into ramshackle homes and united in poverty— the city is a breeding ground for desperation and disease. However, in some districts, there are streets where none fall ill— areas of respite where the plague doctors operate.</p>
			<p class="indent">These holy physicians are masters of medicine, running clinics across the nation that save countless lives. Some roam, following the grim footsteps of plague and curing those afflicted in its wake, others are conscripted in the nation’s army, combating the infection and sickness that runs deadly in war. Many also work as midwives, educators, and city planners.</p>
			<p class="indent">They use their divine powers to combat the invisible, bacterial horrors of the world, with gods such as Asclepius, Dian Cécht, Sekhmet, Serket, and Eir common among those worshiped by such clerics.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although loved and respected for their great powers of healing, many are wary of the plague doctors, for one with the power to battle necrosis and poison also has the power to wield it.</p>
