			<p>In a sprawling, infinite multiverse, there are infinite sprawling paths. Wayfinders are the conclave of rangers dedicated to setting out into the unknown, charting the first maps and breaching the boundaries of untouched planes of existence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Such rangers are true explorers, ever seeking new magic, knowledge, and cultures across the multiverse. A wayfinder must truly be ready for anything, for stepping into the unknown means risking horrors and dangers as yet unimagined. Adaptability and cunning are at the heart of the conclave; without them, no ranger will last long in the uncharted depths of wild and mysterious lands. Despite the dangers, heroes of this conclave are drawn ever onward by the spirit of adventure. To the wayfinder, there is no path more tempting than the path yet untravelled.</p>
