			<p>It is curious how often the laws of the physical world parallel those of the magical. Just as every action has its equal and opposite force, so too does every faith, every god, every instance of magic. Clerics who serve deities of darkness represent the balance to those who worship the gods of light. While others see darkness as terrifying - a blinding shadow of death and nothingness, clerics of this domain see darkness as the truest form of the universe. Once, all things were darkness. One day, they will be again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Such clerics have a saying: “even followers of the brightest light cast shadows”. They often reject the rigid dogma of traditional religious orders, seeing them as inflexible and open to corruption. Typically, clerics of this domain are neutral and chaotic-good in alignment, and almost never lawful. They are at home in the darkness and do not fear it, though they respect its power. They seek to protect allies from the great terrors that dwell in the shadows, and weild its horror as a weapon against foes.</p>

			<p>If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher that targets a creature, you can infuse an additional fragment of divine power into that spell. Choose one bonus effect from the following list to add to that spell’s effect as you cast it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The target can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a range of 30 feet for the next minute.</li>
				<li>The target gains a resistance to radiant and necrotic damage for the next minute.</li>
