			<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. When you enter a berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or safety.</p>

			<p>You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, you can immediately make a weapon attack as a part of the bonus action you used to rage on this turn. In addition, for the next minute, as long as you are raging, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend one additional use of your rage to activate it again.</p>

			<p>When you take the attack action, you can substitute one of those attacks with an attempt to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you for the next minute or until your rage ends or you use this feature again. This effect ends early if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>
