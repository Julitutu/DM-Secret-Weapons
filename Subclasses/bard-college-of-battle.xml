			<p>Bards of the College of Battle train for positions on the front lines. They are the trumpeters, drummers, and bagpipers of war—performers whose songs radiate over the chaos of battle to inspire hope and signal changes in strategy and fortune. Far from mere harbingers of combat, “Battle Bards” are capable, armoured warriors, wielding instruments of song as their instruments of war.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a bonus action, you can begin a War March—a performance of music and motion which lasts for 1 minute. While performing in this way, you can incorporate attacks and the Verbal and Somatic components of your Bardic spells into the War March, allowing you to synchronise spellcasting and song. The War March ends early if you are restrained, or you choose to end it (no action required).</p>
			<p class="indent">When you begin your War March, you and a number of creatures of your choice up to your proficiency bonus within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Bard level (rounded up).</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, while in your War March, when you cast a Bard spell with a casting time of one action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead. If you do, the only action you can take on that turn is the Attack action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining all expended uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can begin a War March a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per long rest. If you have no use remaining, you can begin a War March by expending two uses of your Bardic Inspiration instead.</p>
