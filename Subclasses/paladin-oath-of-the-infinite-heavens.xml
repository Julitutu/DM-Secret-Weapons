			<p>When you take this oath, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Divine Strike.</b> As a bonus action, you imbue a weapon you are holding with the burning radiance of the nine hells. The next time you make an attack roll against a creature with that weapon within the next minute, the weapon lets loose a burst of divine light, and the target takes additional radiant damage equal to 10 + your Paladin level (whether the attack hits or misses).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Turn Fiend.</b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and utter a ferocious battlecry. Each Fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that are the Fiend (Devil) type or are of a CR or Level lower than your paladin level have disadvantage on this Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
