			<p>When you take this oath, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Abyssal Strike.</b> As a bonus action, you imbue a weapon you are holding with the roiling fury of the abyss. The next time you make an attack roll against a creature with that weapon within the next minute, the weapon lets loose a burst of clawing shadow, and the target takes additional necrotic damage equal to 10 + your Paladin level (whether the attack hits or misses).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Terrorize.</b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and utter a ferocious battlecry. Each Humanoid that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
