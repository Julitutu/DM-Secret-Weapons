			<p>As one with the wind, skyriders are a legendary conclave of rangers that roam the globe, defending the birds and beasts of the sky. As you grow, your connection with the primordial energy of air enhances your movement, magic, and combat prowess with the bite, speed, and untethered fury of a hurricane. Skyriders are renowned for their powers of flight, and tales of a lone, skyborne warrior defending innocents from pirates and dragons are found in cultures across the multiverse.</p>
